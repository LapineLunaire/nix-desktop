# Recover Camellya

## TPM unlock failure

Use the LUKS passphrase. Once Secure Boot is verified again, repeat [TPM enrollment](secure-boot.md#installed-system-secure-boot-then-tpm2).

## Reinstall from the installer

Boot an x86_64 NixOS installer in UEFI mode with Secure Boot temporarily disabled. Run as root in Bash. **Skip all partitioning and formatting.**

Unlock and activate the existing volumes:

```sh
cryptsetup open /dev/nvme0n1p2 cryptroot
vgchange -ay camellya
```

1. [Mount the existing volumes](install-camellya.md#2-mount).
2. Reuse `/mnt/persist/nix-config` and its existing UUIDs; change into that checkout.
3. [Restore the SSH host key and secrets](keys.md#host-identity-and-secrets) if needed. The original key decrypts existing secrets without re-encryption.
4. [Restore Secure Boot keys and bind-mount persisted `/var/lib`](secure-boot.md#installer-signing-keys) before reinstalling.
5. [Reinstall and reboot](install-camellya.md#5-install-and-reboot).
6. Re-enable Secure Boot enforcement and [verify it](secure-boot.md#installed-system-secure-boot-then-tpm2).

## Backups for recovery

Keep secure copies of `/home`, the needed [`/persist` data](../hosts/camellya/persistence.nix), the SSH host key, and `/var/lib/sbctl`. Persistence alone is not a backup. Keep secret values, the TPM PIN, and the LUKS recovery passphrase in the password manager.
